            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can recognize and classify different brands of energy drinks. Using Google’s Teachable Machine, I trained a classifier by taking photos of different labeled energy drink cans, such as Reign, Ashoc, C4, 3D and Celsius. The trained model uses these images to predict the brand of an energy drink when an image is provided. This project involves both machine learning and practical application of image classification techniques.</p>

            <h2>Lessons from 'Unmasking AI'</h2>
            <p>In this project, I embarked on a journey to build a machine learning model that could classify energy drink brands based on images of their cans. The model was created using Teachable Machine, a tool developed by Google’s Creative Lab that allows for easy training of machine learning models using your own datasets. Through this process, I trained the model on various images of energy drink cans from brands such as Reign, Ashoc, C4, 3D and Celsius to identify these brands when new images were presented.

                The project itself was not only a technical challenge but also a deep dive into the ethical implications of machine learning, particularly around transparency, biases in datasets, and the power dynamics at play when AI is deployed in real-world scenarios. These themes, which are thoroughly discussed in Joy Buolamwini’s Unmasking AI, were crucial in shaping how I approached the design and implementation of this classifier.
                
                <h3>The Creation Process</h3>
                <p>The first step in creating the energy drink brand classifier was collecting a diverse set of labeled images. Luckily for me I have a collection of 100+ cans of different varieities in my room so I opted to have 5 different types of them to be identified. The importance of diversity in the dataset was emphasized by Buolamwini, who discussed how biases in AI models often stem from skewed datasets. For example, a dataset that is not diverse enough may lead to a model that performs poorly for certain groups or types of data. In my case, ensuring that I had a wide assortment of variations as cans change with flavor so i opted to have as many flavors as i had available for each. This was crucial to making sure the model could generalize well to new, unseen data.
                
                Once the images were collected, I uploaded them into Teachable Machine and trained the model using the pre-configured image classification tools. This was done by manually labeling each image with the corresponding brand. This labeled dataset would then be used to train the machine learning model to recognize patterns associated with each brand’s packaging and logo. After training the model, I tested it by uploading new images and showing cans to the camera and evaluating its predictions.</p>
                
                <h3>Lessons from Unmasking AI</h3>
                <p> When building this project, I found that several of the lessons from Unmasking AI resonated deeply with the process of creating and deploying machine learning models, especially around transparency and the ethical implications of AI technology. Buolamwini’s work discusses the risks of AI systems that are not transparent, which can lead to a lack of accountability and trust. For instance, when I created the model, it was essential to understand what data was used for training and how it could potentially shape the model’s behavior. The transparency of the data sources is crucial for users to trust the outcomes of the model. In my case, I ensured that the images used were clearly labeled and that users could understand the scope of the dataset, making it transparent and trustworthy.
                
                Another critical lesson from Buolamwini’s work was the need for diverse datasets to avoid inherent biases in AI systems. In Unmasking AI, Buolamwini highlights how facial recognition systems have been shown to perform worse on people of color, particularly Black women, due to biased training data that over-represented lighter-skinned faces. Similarly, I had to ensure that the dataset used for my energy drink classifier was not skewed towards one brand or design type, as this would affect the accuracy of the model when it encountered new, unseen images. For example, I made sure to include cans from both major brands (like Reign) and smaller or less common brands to improve the model’s ability to generalize.
                
                Additionally, Buolamwini’s discussion of AI ethics pushed me to consider the implications of my work. Using copyrighted images for training the model could have led to legal concerns, so I opted to use only publicly available images or Cans that I had available to me. This decision was important in reflecting ethical AI practices, where the use of data—especially data that belongs to others—should always be handled responsibly.</p>
                
                <h3>Technical Challenges</h3>
                <p>One of the major challenges I encountered during this project was ensuring that the machine learning model did not overfit. Overfitting occurs when a model is too closely tied to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. To mitigate this risk, I made sure to use a variety of flavors, with different variations in packaging. Buolamwini’s work emphasizes the risks of overfitting in AI systems, especially when they are deployed in real-world scenarios where the input data is unpredictable and varied. This lesson from Unmasking AI reinforced the need for a robust and generalized model.
                
                Moreover, training the model and ensuring its accuracy was a time-consuming process, as it involved not only refining the model but also iterating on the images and dataset itself. This process was marked by multiple rounds of testing and feedback, which closely mirrors the iterative process that Buolamwini advocates for in her work, where AI models are continuously improved and evaluated to prevent unintended consequences.</p>
                
                <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
                <p>Throughout the development of this project, I also had to consider the ethical implications of using machine learning and AI. Buolamwini’s book draws attention to the importance of fairness in AI, and this was something I had to keep in mind. For instance, the accuracy of the model could be impacted by how well the images represented the various energy drink brands. I had to ensure that my dataset was representative and not biased toward one particular design aesthetic or color scheme.
                
                Furthermore, I thought about how this technology could potentially be used in ways that might perpetuate stereotypes or reinforce certain power structures. For example, while the energy drink industry is competitive, the potential for AI systems to be used for brand surveillance or marketing without consumers’ knowledge could be problematic. In my work, I was careful to remain transparent about how the model was created and its intended uses.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Directions</h3>
                <p>While the model works well for classifying energy drink brands based on images, there is always room for improvement. One potential area for development is the expansion of the dataset to include more brands, more diverse packaging, more camera angles, different lighting and even different types of energy drinks, like sugar-free or organic varieties. This would help make the model even more robust and accurate. Additionally, I plan to implement more advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the model’s precision and expand it to other types of products.
                
                Incorporating the lessons learned from Unmasking AI, such as fairness, transparency, and responsibility in AI development, will be essential as I continue to improve this classifier and move toward more complex machine learning projects.</p>

            <h3>Challenges and Considerations</h3>
            <p>While creating the image classifier was exciting, it also came with challenges. One of the main challenges was ensuring that the images I used for training were of high quality and varied. For example, energy drink cans come in different colors, designs, and sizes, which required me to collect a diverse dataset to prevent overfitting. Furthermore, a challenge that I kept in mind throughout the project was the ethical consideration of using copyrighted images. I made sure to use publicly available images(the cans available in my room collection) to avoid any legal issues. This experience helped me reflect on how data can be both a tool and a responsibility in AI development.</p>
