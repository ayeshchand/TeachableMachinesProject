        <h1>Resources for Understanding Implicit Bias</h1>
        <p>Implicit Bias is something that refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect the way we understand. act. and decide about different groups in society. Sometimes, these biases are unconscious, having been influenced by personal experiences or societal pressures. It's not something that has to be held consciously, yet it can shape major aspects of life like the justice system, hiring practices, and others. One of the biggest strengths of the framework that is implicit bias is that it brings attention to even people who are well-meaning, how they contribute to inequity wihtout malicious intention. I feel though that sometimes, with implicit bias being useful at the level of individuals like me and you in society, it leaves the larger groups and people of power to continue demonstrating inequity because of how much we overlook it. Here are some resources to help you learn more!.</p>

            <h2>Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
            <p>The Implicit Bias Test (IBT), also known as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), is a test used to help uncover biases that people may not be aware of. Taking the test can help you discover any implicit biases that you may have, which is the first step to relieving them. Take the Test here!:</p>

            <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
            <p>Intersectionality is an outline for understanding how different identities such as gender, race, and class cause individuals to experience different forms of oppression and discrimination.  Kimberle Crenshaw is an American Civil Rights Activist that coined the term Intersectionality to explain that not all oppression and inequality is created equally. It's a different approach at a view on life that almost ignores the complexities of identities.  Hear her Ted Talk on the importance of Intersectionality and read her article from Columbia Law:</p>
