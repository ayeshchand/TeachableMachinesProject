            <h2>Bob Thomas</h2>
            <p>Known today as the father of cybersecurity, Bob Thomas is credited with the creation of the first computer virus, which shaped what we know today as modern cybersecurity. In 1971, he developed a program called Creeper while working at BBN Technologies, a company that helped develop ARPANET which pioneered the modern internet. His work with "Creeper", with good intention, marked a significant moment in the history of cybersecurity</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed the "Creeper" virus which was an experimental program designed to travel across the ARPANET network between computers. The program was most well known for displaying the notorious message, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" and was created as a fun way to test how programs could spread between connected machines.</li>
                <li> This harmless test helped shape the understanding of network vulnerabilities and helped set a path to what we known today as modern day cybersecurity</li>
                <li>Shortly after the creation of Creeper, a man named Ray Thomlinson who also worked at BBN where Bob worked, created a program called "Reaper", which was made to move across the network and remove Creeper. This was considered the first "antivirus" software.</li>
                <li>This early interaction between the Creeper and Reaper programs displayed one of the first instances of cybersecurity. A program used against a program designed to prevent its ability to replicate across machines.</li>
                <li>Although Bob Thomas didn't have direct influence on the advancements of social equity or intersectionality, the developments that came from early experiments such as the "Creeper" virus contributed to make tech fields more inclusive and equitable</li>
                <li>The Creeper Virus was a predecessor to modern Cyber threats and with how big the field has grown and how threats have evolved, efforts have been made to create job opportunities for people of different social and economic backgrounds. With the evolved threats, anyone is able to be attacked, and the cyber advancements helped for equitable digital access.</li>
                <li>Social Equity has made initiative to conquer the digital divide as some groups are more vulnerable due to lack of resources, and now as a result, Organizations actively seek the voices of people from different race, gender, and socioeconomic background to help create equitable cyber policies and decisions.  </li>
            </ul>
